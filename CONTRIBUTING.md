## üìù Workflow Guidelines

### Adding Workflows

1. **Test First**: Always test workflows in your personal profile before sharing
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make workflow names clear and searchable
3. **Add Descriptions**: Include helpful descriptions for complex workflows
4. **Consider Security**: Never include sensitive data in workflows

### Good Workflow Examples
```json
{
  "name": "Run tests with coverage",
  "command": "npm test -- --coverage",
  "description": "Run all tests and generate coverage report"
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Deploy to staging environment", 
  "command": "npm run deploy:staging && npm run verify:staging",
  "description": "Deploy to staging and verify deployment success"
}
```

### Bad Workflow Examples
```json
{
  "name": "Do stuff",  // Too vague
  "command": "some-command"
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Deploy with API key",
  "command": "deploy --api-key=sk_live_abc123...",  // Contains secrets!
  "description": "Deploy to production"
}
```
